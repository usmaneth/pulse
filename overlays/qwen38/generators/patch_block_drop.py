"""Backport vllm-project/vllm#53388 (disable_eagle_block_drop) into this image.

With EAGLE-style drafters (MTP included), the prefix cache drops the trailing
matched block and re-prefills it on every request. On Codex traffic that is
about one 1664-token block per turn. The option keeps that block. The target
verifies every draft token, so the change can only move acceptance, never
output correctness.

Reads the image's vLLM sources from SRC and writes patched copies to OUT. The
serving profile mounts them over the image files.

    python3 patch_block_drop.py SRC OUT

SRC is an extracted vLLM package (the directory that holds config/ and v1/).
Every anchor must occur exactly once. A source that already holds the backport
is refused, so the generator never patches its own output a second time.
